# What is Shinzō?

Shinzō is a decentralized, trustless, and verifiable indexing network that transforms how applications access blockchain data. In traditional blockchain ecosystems, reading structured on-chain data requires relying on centralized indexers, hosted APIs, or proprietary middleware. These intermediaries determine what data is available, how it is formatted, and when it can be accessed, introducing trust assumptions, performance bottlenecks, and a fundamental contradiction to blockchain’s principles of decentralization and permissionlessness.

Shinzō introduces a new model: **`the read layer becomes part of the blockchain itself`**.

## Validator-Embedded Indexing

Instead of outsourcing indexing to external companies, Shinzō empowers the blockchain’s own validators, the nodes already responsible for producing and verifying blocks to index data at the moment it is created. Validators run a lightweight Shinzō client alongside their normal node software, enabling them to:

- Extract and structure blockchain data in real time
- Publish verifiable, censorship-resistant indexes
- Make on-chain state accessible without third-party trust

This transforms indexing into a native network-level function, not an external service.

## A Local-First, Trustless Read Layer

Shinzō̄ goes beyond decentralized indexing. It establishes a local-first, permissionless read layer, making access to blockchain data as trust-minimized and verifiable as writing to it.

Shinzō provides:

### Validator-Embedded Data Access

Data is indexed and verified at the source of truth, directly by the network's validators.

### Peer-to-Peer Synchronization

Structured blockchain data replicates across nodes, remaining available even when offline or disconnected from centralized services.

### Cross-Network Transformation

Data can flow seamlessly across chains, applications, and environments without breaking trust assumptions or relying on centralized relayers.
